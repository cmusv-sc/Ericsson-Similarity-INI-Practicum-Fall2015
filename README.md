Ericsson Similarity Practicum
=============================

Overview
--------

In today’s world, buyers are being presented with an increasing range of choices 
while sellers are faced with the challenge of personalizing their advertising efforts. 
Recommendation engines help narrow choices to those that best meet your particular 
needs. The goal of such systems is to give meaningful recommendations to user about 
items or products that might interest him/her. Suggestions for books on Amazon, or
movies on Netflix, are real world examples of recommender systems.

Background Study 
----------------

The most common approaches to recommendations are collaborative filtering and 
content filtering. Collaborative Filtering systems analyze historical interactions alone, 
while Content-based Filtering systems are based on profile attributes.

**Collaborative filtering** methods are based on collecting and analyzing a large 
amount of information on users’ behaviors, activities or preferences and predicting 
what users will like based on their similarity to other users. Some of the types of 
collaborative filtering techniques are:
  1. User-Item Collaborative Filtering: It is used to predict how a particular user 
will rate a particular item, 

  2. Item-Item CF: It is a filtering mechanism based on the similarity between 
items calculated using user’s ratings of those items. It is used to predict degree 
of similarity between two items based on user’s ratings

  3. User-User CF: It is a filtering mechanism used to find similar users. Clustering 
similar users could be useful in predicting which groups of users prefer a 
certain item.

**Content-based filtering** methods are based on a description of the item and a profile 
of the user’s preference. In a content-based recommender system, keywords are used 
to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user 
likes.


Project Goals
-------------

This project attempts build a set of similar items based on existing algorithms and libraries 
with existing datasets. We plan to identify the pros and cons of each algorithm, and evaluate 
them with a user study. This project attempts to insert a human component into recommender 
evaluation through a gamified evaluation system that allow users to rate the correctness of 
algorithms developed in research.
